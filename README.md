# Tech Basics - Assignment 1

There is a multi cuisine hotel which takes order on phone and then orders are recorded in file named order.txt

### Navigating The Linux Filesystem

* Change directory to folder fsdse-techbasics-assignment-1
  - List down what there in folder
  - List down hidden files in folder

### Working With Files And Directories

* Check what kind of file is orders.txt
* Display the content of file orders.txt
* Let's explore order.txt more and try to solve query below using `head`, `tail` commands
  - Get first 10 orders
  - Get last 10 orders
  - Get last 3 orders
  - Get first 4 orders
  - Get order from 10 to last
  - Get all order, except last 10 order
* Create a new folder named 'orders'
* Copy orders.txt file in the orders folder
* Rename orders folder to 'orders_backup'
* We don't need tmp folder, delete a folder named tmp
* We don't need tmp.txt file, delete a file name 'tmp.txt'
* Lets add below orders to the list using nano command
  - American Pizza
  - Italian Pizza
  
Now again repeat all above exercises with order.txt using `head` and `tail` commands. Result will be different this time as new two orders are added to list using `nano` command.
