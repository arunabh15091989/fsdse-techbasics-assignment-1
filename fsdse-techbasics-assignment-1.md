### Navigating The Linux Filesystem

* Change directory to folder fsdse-techbasics-assignment-1
  - List down what there in folder [ ls -l ]
  - List down hidden files in folder [ ls -la ]

### Working With Files And Directories

* Check what kind of file is orders.txt
* Display the content of file orders.txt
* Let's explore order.txt more and try to solve query below using `head`, `tail` commands
  - Get first 10 orders
  - Get last 10 orders
  - Get last 3 orders
  - Get first 4 orders
  - Get order from 10 to last
  - Get all order, except last 10 order
* Create a new folder named 'orders'
* Copy orders.txt file in the orders folder
* Rename orders folder to 'orders_backup'
* We don't need tmp folder, delete a folder named tmp
* We don't need tmp.txt file, delete a file name 'tmp.txt'
* Lets add below orders to the list using nano command
  - American Pizza
  - Italian Pizza
* Now again repeat all above exercises with order.txt using `head` and `tail` commands. Result will be different this time as new two orders are added to list using `nano` command.
* Locate the word "Chinese" in order.txt file using command line.
* Locate the word "Fish" in order.txt file and highlight using color using command line.
* Locate the word "Salad" in order.txt file with the line number where Salad is present using command line.
* Locate the word "rice" in order.txt file with and make sure it's case-insensitive match.
